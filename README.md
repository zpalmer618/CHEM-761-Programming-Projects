# CHEM-761-Programming-Projects

These projects were designed by the Crawford group at Virginia Tech to better assist students in understanding how a quantum chemistry package produces the energy
of a molecule. It was originally geared toward the C++ programming language, however my projects are all written in Go with the help of a friend of mine. If you're
interested in learning more about these projects visit the main crawford Github:
